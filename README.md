## Overview
Chinese zodiac has five elements: wood, fire, earth, metal and water. You can find unlimited number of documents on these.
Chinese zodiac has three treasures:

- jing for the physical body
- qi for the horizontal world: humans, animals, connections, all kinds of energy: eg. breath and food, communication, etc.
- shen for a connection with somewhat spiritual

Every day has an element that effects our life in many ways, in all three levels. This little app shows which ones.

The rest is upon you. You can find yourself a guru/master/consultant who can calculate your own formula based on your birth date and check out how these effects impact you.

I take no responsibility if your life goes up or down based on this. Use with attention and responsibility.

## Usage

Install Flutter and Dart. Then check out https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/flutter-cli

On the top of the screen three parts are shen, qi and jing elements for the chosen day in top to bottom order.
Below there's a button that shows the date for the chosen day. Click opens a date picker to change the day you'd like to see the elements of.
On mobile you can also swipe left and right the days.
