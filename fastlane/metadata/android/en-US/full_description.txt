Chinese zodiac has five elements: wood, fire, earth, metal and water. You can find unlimited number of documents on these. Chinese zodiac has three treasures:
<ul>
<li>jing for the physical body</li>
<li>qi for the horizontal world: humans, animals, connections, all kinds of energy: eg. breath and food, communication, etc.</li>
<li>shen for a connection with somewhat spiritual</li>
</ul>
Every day has an element that effects our life in many ways, in all three levels. This little app shows which ones.
The rest is upon you. You can find yourself a guru/master/consultant who can calculate your own formula based on your birth date and check out how these effects impact you.
I take no responsibility if your life goes up or down based on this. Use with
attention and responsibility.
